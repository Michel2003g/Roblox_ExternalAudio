# Roblox_ExternalAudio

This program is ment for the roblox plugin SoundScape. (Only windows version is tested)

Install it via zip and unpack it to a public directory on your pc.
Run Start.exe inside the server Folder. (not sure if Start.dmg / Start.elf work. I can not test it myself.)
A window will popup saying its listening to Port 8000
Visit http://localhost:8000 to be able to hear sounds that are played by the plugin.
